### Decision Tree Regression Analysis on Population Data
Objective: To analyze population data from various countries using decision tree regression, aiming to predict future population growth based on historical trends.


## Expected Outcomes:
- Trained Model: A trained Decision Tree regression model capable of predicting population growth rates.

- Predictions: The model should provide population growth predictions for the year 2017 (or any specified year).

- Model Performance: An RMSLE score that helps quantify how close the model's predictions are to the actual growth rates. A lower RMSLE indicates better predictive performance.

#### Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the model's performance.
Train a decision tree regression model using the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) to understand its accuracy.
